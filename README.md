# GPTranslate
This project features a Python bot designed to simplify and translate the text of a document using ChatGPT and Google Translate. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

1. Text Simplification: The bot takes the text of a document and simplifies it using ChatGPT, making it easier to understand.
2. Translation: After receiving the simplified text, the bot utilizes Google Translate to translate it into Persian.
3. Telegram Integration: Once translated, the text is sent to Telegram using a Telegram bot.

Notably, instead of relying on ChatGPT's API, the project leverages Selenium to interact with ChatGPT and Google Translate.
